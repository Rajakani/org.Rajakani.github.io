DISCLOSURES

As someone who writes on the web it’s wise for me to point out my financial and other interests so people have a sense of my biases. Some of the external links in my blogs are of affiliate e-commerce sites. So if you make a purchase through these links, I do get a cut. I use this money for maintaining this website.</p>
